# Installation Testing and Documentation for v3.0.0

As the [documentation plan](https://github.com/kubesphere/website/issues/113) of KubeSphere v3.0.0 mentioned, we are going to test the installation of KubeSphere v3.0.0 on some popular infrastructure platforms and Kubernetes services, and write the installation guide accordingly. It will help community users to easily get started with KubeSphere v3.0.0, makes KubeSphere run everywhere. We look forward to seeing that community users and developers can also join us and contribute to the testing and documentation task.

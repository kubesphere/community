# Installation Testing and Documentation for v3.0.0

As the [documentation plan](https://github.com/kubesphere/website/issues/113) of KubeSphere v3.0.0 mentioned, we are going to test the installation of KubeSphere v3.0.0 on some popular infrastructure platforms and Kubernetes services, and write the installation guide accordingly. It will help community users to easily get started with KubeSphere v3.0.0, makes KubeSphere run everywhere. We look forward to seeing that community users and developers can also join us and contribute to the testing and documentation task.

If you would like to contribute to community, raise a PR to add yourself as an assignee into this table as follows.

## Installing KubeSphere on Linux

After using [Kubekey](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey) to test the installation on these platforms, you can write an installation guide to elaborate on how to set up a highly available KubeSphere and Kubernetes cluster on them, including the best practice of persistent storage, load balancer, networking on these platforms. We will provide a standard doc template for reference.

## Installing KubeSphere on Kubernetes

After testing the [ks-installer](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer) on these Kubernetes services, you can write an installation guide to elaborate on how to deploy a production-ready KubeSphere cluster on them, including the best practice of persistent storage, load balancer, networking on these platforms. We will provide a standard doc template for reference.

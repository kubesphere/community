## Contribution rules

Before you start contributing, read our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) and learn about our community working model to understand the way KubeSphere community works. Get familiar with the contributing rules, recommended [Git workflow](./developer-guide/guides/Development-workflow), and issues workflow we use in KubeSphere so you can apply them later in practice as an active contributor.

## Special Interest Group

Through SIGs, the KubeSphere community members collaborate and contribute to topics of long-term interest for KubeSphere and its community. Generally, SIGs can be either vertically focused on particular components and features, and can span multiple functional and technical domains. There are some SIGs in KubeSphere community, see [KubeSphere  Special Interest Group](sigs.md) for details.

## Working Group

Working Group (WG) facilitate discussions and work on short-lived, concrete topics that either result from the work of SIG groups or which the community members initiate directly. Each SIG can propose a new WG based on the detailed requirements and issues.

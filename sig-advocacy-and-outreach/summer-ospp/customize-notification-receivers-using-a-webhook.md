# Project

Customize Notification Receivers Using A Webhook -【 Deprecated 】

## Project Goal

Enable [Notification Manager](https://github.com/kubesphere/notification-manager) to obtain a notification receiver list from a webhook so that users can customize the notification receivers.

## Skills to Learn/Improve

* Golang
* REST API
* Kubernetes

## Background

Currently, Notification Manager determines the notification receivers based on the RoleBindings of a namespace. Under this mechanism, certain users who need to receive notifications may not be notified. For example, when a user has the authority to manage a namespace but is not in the namespace, notifications from the namespace are not sent to the user.

We hope to provide a mechanism that allows users to customize the notification receivers.

## Project details

We plan to inject a sidecar into the Notification Manager deployment, which implements the logic of obtaining the receiver list. The sidecar needs to support the following features:

* Provides an interface for obtaining the receiver list based on the namespace. The interface should have uniform input parameters and return values.
* Caches the receiver list to reduce resource consumption.

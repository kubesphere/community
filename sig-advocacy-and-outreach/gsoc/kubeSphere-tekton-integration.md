## Project Goal

Integrate [Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) as an alternative CI/CD engine of [KubeSphere](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/) DevOps.

## Skills to Learn/Improve

* Golang
* Tekton
* Jenkins
* Kubernetes

## Details

### Background

Tekton is a cloud-native CI/CD project. Compared to Jenkins, Tekton can take full advantage of the Kubernetes ecosystem. For example, Tekton, as a serverless component, is very easy to scale. However, it could be difficult for new users to operate Tekton for its lack of user-friendly UI. We would like to make full use of the advantages of Tekton, and make it easy to use in KubeSphere.

### Project details

Currently, Jenkins is the engine of KubeSphere DevOps component. The [Pipeline controller](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/blob/master/pkg/controller/pipeline/pipeline_controller.go) is responsible for converting the CRD of pipelines to Jenkins jobs.
Please consider the compatibility of the [CRD](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere/blob/master/pkg/apis/devops/v1alpha3/pipeline_types.go). Jenkins remains to be the first choice until we have sufficient reasons to change it.

## Scope

Since GSoC 2021 only has one phase, you can just finish the backend part. It means that using the CLI to achieve our goal is acceptable. For example, users can use [kubectl](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl) to create and trigger pipelines and also view logs of them.

## Outcomes

The potential outcomes might include:
* Pipeline CRD compatible with Jenkins
* Log, and the archive storage solution
* Multi-branch pipeline support
* A how-to document that contains the integration, usage, users case

## Quickstart

You can start with [a minimal KubeSphere](https://kubesphere.io/docs/quick-start/minimal-kubesphere-on-k8s/). [Enable the DevOps](https://kubesphere.io/docs/pluggable-components/devops/) component once KubeSphere is ready and explore KubeSphere DevOps system by yourself.
[Install Tekton Pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md) first, then get familiar with various features by following [the tutorial](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md)!

First of all, take the time to read the [Google Summer of Code Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/).

Also, bookmark the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline). Print it and hang it where you can see it every day!

### Eligibility steps

You must verify that you are eligible to participate in the program. We cannot make any exceptions. Please:

1. Make sure you are[eligible to participate in the program](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation)
2. If you are an accepted student in the United States of America on an F1 visa, you must obtain [authorization before you can participate](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#i_am_an_accepted_student_in_the_united_states_on_an_f1_visa_how_do_i_get_authorization_to_participate).

### Application steps

1. Check out the [GSoC 2020 Project ideas](https://github.com/kubesphere/community/tree/master/sig-advocacy-and-outreach/gsoc)
2. Select an interesting project idea or draft your own proposal.
3. Use the [project proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDg98d98rkGls-b_u0K3kUoX7xV8JTLMpkDjNgJeaMo/edit?usp=sharing) to write your project proposal.
4. If you are not familiar with KubeSphere, read the introductory info on the website and try using KubeSphere with one of your previous projects.
5. Join the *kubesphere-gsoc-all-public@googlegroups.com* mailing list.
6. Join theÂ KubeSphere Slack [GSoC](https://kubesphere.slack.com/messages/sig-advocacy-and-outreach) channel
7. Using the mailing list or Slack channel:
    1. Introduce yourself to the KubeSphere GSoC community,
    2. Start a discussion about a KubeSphere GSoC project.
    3. Be patient, there are time zones, and mentors have full-time jobs outside of the KubeSphere community.
8. Eventually, you may have to join both the Slack channel and the mailing list, but initially, you can reach us either way.
9. Add GSoC office hours to your calendar (to be announced on [the main GSoC project](https://github.com/kubesphere/community/tree/master/sig-advocacy-and-outreach/gsoc) page).
10. Recommended: Do some contributions in the area of your project idea

You can find more details about the application steps below.

### Expectations

When you apply to the GSoC program, you are committing to 30..40 hours of coding per week for the duration of the program.

1. We expect students to get involved in project discussions at the beginning of the student application period in order to have the opportunity to discuss the project with potential mentors and to jointly review the proposal drafts.
2. We expect students to attend at least one office hours during the application period.

### Student Proposals

We expect proposals from students to contain all the sections discussed in the [Google Summer of Code Student Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/), specifically the [Elements of a Quality Proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal#elements-of-a-quality-proposal).

Students need to use the [project proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CaavgYftUHHVkBXWuf2_abQQ3c4OaDU8LgnpPLxVfY8/edit?usp=sharing) to write their proposals. Student proposals should not be confused with [project ideas](https://github.com/kubesphere/community/tree/master/sig-advocacy-and-outreach/gsoc).

We strongly encourage students to engage with the mentors as early as possible. If you wait until the last few days to submit a proposal, mentors will not have time to discuss it with you, and your chances of being accepted are greatly diminished.

You can have additional sections or paragraphs if they are applicable:

1. A contribution history section: if you participated in any open-source projects or proposed any patches in KubeSphere, you can definitely list them in this section.
2. An appendix section of detailed design, architecture, or implementation. This section could contain code samples, pseudo-code, diagrams, mock UIs, etc.
3. A section related to testing your project: unit tests, integration tests, test automation.
4. A section or paragraph on deliverables: demos, presentations, releases (alpha, official).
5. A section or paragraph on improvements, bug fixes, benefits to the community.
6. Any other section that the student deems is applicable and helps the proposal

In the proposal, we also expect students to disclose all known commitments that overlap with any of the program phases (community bonding, coding periods, evaluation periods, etc.):

1. Disclose your vacation periods, a part-time or full-time job, school, classes, tests, exams, periods of non-availability, etc.
2. Failure to disclose known commitments may lead to immediate failure, especially in the case of another job or internship.
3. Unexpected events: we understand there can be unexpected events in life, and those cannot be planned. Please inform us as soon as possible if you need time away from the program. You can use private messaging for sensitive information.

### First email to kubesphere-gsoc-all-public

* Please use the *[GSOC 2021 PROPOSAL] Your Name and Project Title* subject in mailing lists.
    * If another student is interested in the same project idea, you can contribute to their thread, or start your own thread.
* Contents. In the first e-mail we would be interested to see the following information:
    * A short self-introduction: your area of study, interests, background
    * Motivation letter. Why are you interested in the KubeSphere project? Which projects ideas do you want to work on?
    * If you participate in open-source projects, please reference them
    * If you have a GitHub, Twitter account, a blog, or technical/scientific publications, please reference them as well

### First contributions

We highly recommend making some contributions to the project while you work on the application. It will help you to polish the proposal, and mentors will consider contributions and interactions with the community when processing applications.

# AI Assistant for KubeSphere Community Q&A Based on LangGraph

## Project Objective
Develop an intelligent Q&A system using LangGraph and the Milvus vector database. This system will integrate the KubeSphere community's knowledge base, documents, and FAQs, and construct an Agentic RAG workflow to provide accurate and real-time technical support and answers, thereby improving user experience and technical support efficiency in the community.

## Project Background
As the KubeSphere community rapidly expands, the demand for technical support and problem-solving continues to grow. Traditional document search and manual responses can no longer meet the demand for high-efficiency, high-quality services. By leveraging large language models and vector database technology, this Agentic RAG-based intelligent Q&A system can significantly enhance community support efficiency. Users will be able to quickly access accurate technical information, reducing the burden on community maintainers.

## Project Details

### Development Tasks
- Build a knowledge base from KubeSphere documentation, GitHub issues, and community discussions
- Use Milvus vector database to store and index document content
- Design an Agentic RAG workflow using LangGraph to implement the complete Q&A dialogue process
- Develop adaptive retrieval strategies to improve answer accuracy and relevance
- Develop an API interface for the Q&A system to support integration with the KubeSphere console
- Implement a context-aware dialogue system that supports multi-turn interactions and in-depth discussions

### Technical Implementation
- Use LangGraph to construct the Agentic RAG workflow, including query analysis, document retrieval, answer generation, and self-verification steps
- Use Milvus for efficient similarity search to support large-scale document retrieval
- Deploy free models from SiliconFlow platform (such as Qwen2.5, GLM-4) to ensure system availability and performance
- Build a feedback mechanism to continuously optimize answer quality
- Support multiple languages to meet the needs of global community users

### Project Deliverables
1. Develop the core Agentic RAG workflow using LangGraph 
   1.1 Build the KubeSphere community knowledge base and integrate it with Milvus 
   1.2 Develop Q&A interfaces compatible with open-source models like Qwen2.5 and GLM-4 

2. Develop a web front-end interface integrated with the KubeSphere console 
   2.1 Design a user interface that supports multi-turn dialogue 
   2.2 Integrate with the KubeSphere console based on the Luban framework 

3. Write comprehensive project documentation and user manuals

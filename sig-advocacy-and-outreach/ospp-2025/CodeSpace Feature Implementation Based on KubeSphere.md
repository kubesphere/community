# CodeSpace Feature Implementation Based on KubeSphere

## Project Objective
Implement an online web IDE similar to GitHub CodeSpace based on vscode-server, enhancing services for KubeSphere private cloud environments.

## Project Background
GitHub CodeSpace is a highly innovative capability that supports the DevContainer protocol, automatically deploying the development environment. This is very friendly for new team members, saving them from the painful setup process and allowing them to focus more on coding.

However, in private cloud environments, a lightweight CodeSpace solution is highly practical for internal enterprise use, especially for lightweight projects. This project aims to bring CodeSpace capabilities to KubeSphere.

## Project Details

### Development Tasks
- Customize CRDs to describe the entire project configuration
- Design configuration files within the project by mimicking the DevContainer format
- Develop an Operator to monitor CRD configurations and create DEV PODs based on the project configuration
- Use shared storage to store and persist project source code

### Technical Implementation
- Develop the Kubernetes Operator using Python
- Customize CRD configurations with reasonable default values
- Develop a KubeSphere plugin to create a simple front-end interface
- Support at least Python, Java, and Node.js projects

### Project Deliverables
1. Develop the Kubernetes Operator using the kopf framework 
   1.1 Programming Language: Python; Framework: kopf 
   1.2 Customize CRDs for project configuration with appropriate default values 
   1.3 Implement and validate the core Operator logic 

2. Develop a web front-end interface integrated with the KubeSphere console 
   2.1 Frontend Technologies: JavaScript, React (integrated with KubeSphere frontend) 
   2.2 Integrate with the KubeSphere console using the Luban framework 

3. Documentation Support 
   3.1 Write complete project documentation and user manuals 
   3.2 Provide test projects and detailed testing steps

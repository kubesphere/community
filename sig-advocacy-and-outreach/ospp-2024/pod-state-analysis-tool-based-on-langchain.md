# Project

Pod status analysis tool implemented based on LangChain.

## Project Goal

Develop a lightweight analysis tool using LangChain.js and Ollama to analyze the status of Kubernetes Pods. Integrate this tool into KubeSphere's container status observation page to achieve a seamless user experience and efficient Pod status analysis.

## Skills to Learn/Improve

- Front-end technologies: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React.
- Analysis tool interface: API interfaces provided by Ollama.
- Container platform: Kubernetes, KubeSphere.

## Background

With the widespread adoption of Kubernetes clusters, real-time monitoring and in-depth analysis of Pod status have become increasingly important. As a comprehensive container management platform, KubeSphere needs to provide users with intuitive and efficient tools for observing and analyzing container status. Currently, KubeSphere lacks an integrated and user-friendly Pod status analysis tool, which limits users' ability to gain a deep understanding of cluster status and respond quickly.

## Project Details

Development content:
- Design and implement a front-end interface for Pod status analysis.
- Utilize Ollama's API interfaces for real-time data retrieval and analysis.
- Integrate the analysis tool into KubeSphere's existing observation page.

Technical implementation:
- Front-end: Use the React framework combined with LangChain.js for data presentation and user interaction.
- Retrieve data and analysis results through the API interfaces provided by Ollama.
- Deploy the Ollama container to the KubeSphere cluster to ensure the stable operation of the analysis tool.

## Outcomes

- Front-end interface and interaction logic of the Pod status analysis tool
- Deployment and configuration guide for the Ollama container
- Operation guide and documentation for integrating with KubeSphere

# How to build KubeSphere?

This document walks you through how to get started with building KubeSphere in your local environment.

## Preparing the environment

### Go

KubeSphere development is based on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), both of them are written in [Go](http://golang.org/). If you don't have a Go development environment, please [set it up](http://golang.org/doc/code.html).

| Kubernetes     | requires Go |
|----------------|-------------|
| 1.13+          | >= 1.12     |

> Tips:
> - Ensure your GOPATH and PATH have been configured in accordance with the Go
environment instructions.
> - It's recommended to install [macOS GNU tools](https://www.topbug.net/blog/2013/04/14/install-and-use-gnu-command-line-tools-in-mac-os-x) when using MacOS for development.

### Docker

KubeSphere components are often deployed as containers in Kubernetes. If you need to rebuild the KubeSphere components in the Kubernetes cluster, you'll need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) in advance.


### Dependency management

KubeSphere uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies in the `vendor/` tree.

> Note: KubeSphere uses `go module` to manage dependencies, but the development process still relies on `GOPATH`
> In the CRD development process, you need to use tools to automatically generate code. The tools used by KubeSphere still need to rely on `GOPATH`. 
> For Chinese contributors who are going to pull the go module, we recommend you to use [goproxy.cn](https://goproxy.cn) as the proxy.

## Building KubeSphere Core on a local OS/shell environment

### For Quick Taste Binary

When you go get KubeSphere, you can choose the version you want to get: `go get kubesphere.io/kubesphere@version-you-want`

>For modules stored in source control repositories, the version suffix can
 also be a commit hash, branch identifier, or other syntax known to the
 source control system, as in 'go get golang.org/x/text@master'.
 The version suffix @latest explicitly requests the default behavior
 described above.

> Note: Before getting KubeSphere, you need to synchronize the contents of the `replace` section of the go.mod file of the KubeSphere you want to version.

```bash
mkdir ks-tmp
cd ks-tmp
echo 'module kubesphere' > go.mod
echo 'replace (
        github.com/Sirupsen/logrus v1.4.1 => github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.4.1
      	github.com/kiali/kiali => github.com/kubesphere/kiali v0.15.1-0.20190407071308-6b5b818211c3
      	github.com/kubernetes-sigs/application => github.com/kubesphere/application v0.0.0-20190518133311-b9d9eb0b5cf7
      )' >> go.mod

GO111MODULE=on go get kubesphere.io/kubesphere@d649e3d0bbc64bfba18816c904819e4850d021e0
GO111MODULE=on go build -o ks-apiserver kubesphere.io/kubesphere/cmd/ks-apiserver # build ks-apiserver
GO111MODULE=on go build -o ks-apigateway kubesphere.io/kubesphere/cmd/ks-apigateway # build ks-apigateway
GO111MODULE=on go build -o ks-controller-manager kubesphere.io/kubesphere/cmd/controller-manager # build ks-controller-manager
GO111MODULE=on go build -o ks-iam kubesphere.io/kubesphere/cmd/ks-iam # build ks-iam
```

### For Building KubeSphere Core Images

KubeSphere components are often deployed as a container in a Kubernetes cluster, you may need to build a Docker image locally.

1. Clone repo to local.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere.git
cd kubesphere
```

2. Run Docker command to build image.

```bash
# $REPO is the docker registry to push to
# $Tag is the tag name of the docker image
# The full go build process will be executed in the Dockerfile, so you may need to set GOPROXY in it.
docker build -f build/ks-apigateway/Dockerfile -t $REPO/ks-apigateway:$TAG .
docker build -f build/ks-apiserver/Dockerfile -t $REPO/ks-apiserver:$TAG .
docker build -f build/ks-iam/Dockerfile -t $REPO/ks-account:$TAG .
docker build -f build/ks-controller-manager/Dockerfile -t $REPO/ks-controller-manager:$TAG .
docker build -f ./pkg/db/Dockerfile -t $REPO/ks-devops:flyway-$TAG ./pkg/db/
```

### For KubeSphere Core local development building.


1. Create a `kubesphere` work directory under `GOPATH` and clone the source code.

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/kubesphere.io/
cd $GOPATH/src/kubesphere.io/
git clone https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere
```

2. Use command `make` to build binary

```bash
make ks-apiserver # Build ks-apiserver binary
make ks-iam # Build ks-iam binary
make controller-manager # Build ks-controller-manager binary
make ks-apigateway # Build ks-apigateway binary
```

If you need to build a docker image, you can refer to the previous section.

### Test

Itâ€˜s recommended to use local Kubernetes clusters, such as [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/), or to install an single-node [all-in-one](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere#all-in-one) environment (Kubernetes-based) for quick testing.

> Tip: It also supports to use Docker for Desktop ships with Kubernetes as the test environment.


## Building Other Module of KubeSphere 

Kubesphere has some pluggable modules such as ServiceMesh, DevOps, Logging, OpenPitrix ...
Some of these modules have their unique build methods, refer to the their documentation accordingly.

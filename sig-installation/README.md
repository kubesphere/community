# Installation Special Interest Group

The Installation SIG is to develop KubeSphere installer for a variety of environment and options such as all-in-one, multi-node, install on existing K8s cluster. The code repository is hosted at [ks-installer](https://github.com/kubesphere/ks-installer). Meanwhile, the all-in-one and multi-node installer is changed to [KubeKey](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubekey).

## Package Management

The system components of KubeSphere are packed into Helm charts. Please refer to the [tutorial](./guideline/Helm-package-development-tutorial.md) for details.
